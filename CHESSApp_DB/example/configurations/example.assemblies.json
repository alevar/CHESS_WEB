The lack of allelic variation in the haploid sequence allows for unambiguous resolution of haplotype and segmental duplication. Sequence from this project will be used to increase the continuity of the human reference sequence."

Based on analysis of strains found in four species of monkeys from Bioko Island, which was isolated from the mainland by rising sea levels about 11,000 years ago, it has been concluded that SIV has been present in monkeys and apes for at least 32,000 years, and probably much longer."
